  ## Description

  This application is to show how to combine MySQL, express, and express-handlebars into one application.  This app is a simple "game" in which the user can input a burger name.  This name would then transfer to the "Order Up" table, which would then be moved to the "Devoured" table upon pressing the "Devour" button.  This app utlizes the aforementioned MySQL, express, and express-handlebars to create this in a Model View Controller (MVC) structural pattern.

  ## Installation

  No installation is necessary, as the application is successfully deployed at: https://lit-cliffs-28895.herokuapp.com/

  ## Usage

  Once the application is opened, the user may go to the "Order a Burger" form on the left of the screen.  Once they input a burger, they can then click the "Order Burger" button, which will add that burger to the table.  If the user may wish to, they may click the "Devour" button underneath that, or any other burger which will transfer that burger to the "Devoured" table.
